<p>Thank you for coming</p>
<p>Do not use this site within 100 miles of gwa. It will detect the digital signal and come for you.</p>
    <p>I'm not sure how we can stop gwa. Zamboner is not real. It's a myth. We have no power here.</p>
    <p>Please just run from it. It's going to reset the planet. We're doomed.</p>
    <p>UPDATE August 6th, 2047: THIS IS NOT A DRILL. RUN. LEAVE YOUR NET CONNECTOR. IT IS COMING.</p>
<p>Update August 7th, 2047: The above is a false alarm. gwa is not here. Please go back on your Net Connectors. Have a nice day :)</p>
